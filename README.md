# Ivan Robles - Board Games React App

If you are interested in getting to know me, my software engineering, or my art, you've come to the right place! This is a website I single-handedly created for just this purpose. I designed it to be simple, but fun, for the user. If you want to give me any comments or just say hi, go ahead!

## What to Expect

This website demonstrates my abilities as a software engineer and designer! You can learn a little bit about my life, see some of the art I have created over the years, or explore the programming projects I've worked on. As a fun bonus, you can even walk through my interactive resume, which is like a simple video game full of drawings I created.

## How it Was Made

The entire website was made using only html, css, and javascript! Although I know how to use React.js, I enjoy rendering everything myself. In addition, I used Photoshop to create many of the images you will see (especially in the interactive resume). I attempted to create many custom effects that make it more interesting. This means the website is probably not as coherent as a large company's website (where they would likely have, for example, the same effect for every button), but this was specifically so I could 1) make it fun and 2) get more practice creating everything from scratch.

## Games Included

Currently, the website allows users to play locally 3 different 2-player games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-Four, and Reversi (Othello).

**In Tic-Tac-Toe**, players take turns placing their tokens on a 3x3 grid. The player to first get three in-a-row is the winner.

**Connect-Four** is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, except for two key differences: players must get 4 in a row, and players can only place their tokens on the bottom-most available spot in the column picked, as if the entire board has gravity pulling the pieces from the bottom.

**In Reservsi**, also called Othello (although they have slight variations in their rules), the object of the game is to have the most tokens on the board once the board is full. Players take turns placing their token, each time having to "flank" or "capture" the opponents tokens in a straight line.
