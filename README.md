# Ivan Robles - Board Games React App

If you are interested in getting to know me, my software engineering, or my art, you've come to the right place! This is a website I single-handedly created for just this purpose. I designed it to be simple, but fun, for the user. If you want to give me any comments or just say hi, go ahead!

## What to Expect

This website demonstrates my abilities as a software engineer and designer! You can learn a little bit about my life, see some of the art I have created over the years, or explore the programming projects I've worked on. As a fun bonus, you can even walk through my interactive resume, which is like a simple video game full of drawings I created.

## How it Was Made

The entire website was made using only html, css, and javascript! Although I know how to use React.js, I enjoy rendering everything myself. In addition, I used Photoshop to create many of the images you will see (especially in the interactive resume). I attempted to create many custom effects that make it more interesting. This means the website is probably not as coherent as a large company's website (where they would likely have, for example, the same effect for every button), but this was specifically so I could 1) make it fun and 2) get more practice creating everything from scratch.

## Games Included

Currently, the website allows users to play locally 3 different 2-player games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-Four, and Reversi (Othello).
